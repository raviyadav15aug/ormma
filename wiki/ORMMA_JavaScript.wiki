#summary ORMMA JavaScript API that all ad developers can use.
#sidebar SideBar

=Introduction=
The adoption of the ORMMA standard allows all ad developers to use the same !JavaScript methods and know that their ad will behave as expected on a variety of platforms.

This page outlines all the methods and events that ad developers will have access to. ORMMA completely integrates the IAB MRAID standard. For methods and events that are only supported by MRAID containers, please find the IAB logo.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />


=Methods=
_`*`methods marked with an asterisk are dependent on the device. Ad developers and SDK implementers must use the supports() method to identify what methods are available._


==addEventListener==
{{{
	ormma.addEventListener(event, listener)
	mraid.addEventListener(event, listener)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

Use this method to subscribe a specific handler method to a specific event. In this way, multiple listeners can subscribe to a specific event, and a single listener can handle multiple events. All ORMMA events are listed below, with the MRAID subset of events listed first:

|| *value*        || *description*                       || *MRAID* ||
|| ready          || report initialize complete          || *       ||
|| error          || report error has occurred           || *       ||
|| stateChange    || report state changes                || *       ||
|| viewableChange || report viewable changes             || *       ||
|| network        || report network connectivity changes ||         ||
|| keyboard       || report soft keyboard changes        ||         ||
|| orientation    || report orientation changes          ||         ||
|| heading        || report heading changes              ||         ||
|| location       || report location changes             ||         ||
|| response       || report response from request call   ||         ||
|| screen         || report screen size changes          ||         ||
|| shake          || report device being shaken          ||         ||
|| size           || report ad size changes              ||         ||
|| tilt           || report tilt changes                 ||         ||




    parameters:
        * event [String - required] : name of event to listen for
        * listener [Function - required] : function name (or anonymous function) to execute

    return value: none

    events triggered: none

    side effects: registering listeners for device features may power up sensors in the device that will reduce battery life.

    level: 1

==close==
{{{
	ormma.close()
	mraid.close()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

The close method will cause the ad webview to downgrade its state. It will also fire the stateChange event. For ads in an expanded state, the close() method moves to a default state.

For ads in a default state, the close() method moves to a hidden state. This method may be used by ad designers as an addition to the SDK-enforced close ability.

An expanded or interstitial ad must provide an end-user with the ability to close the expanded creative. This is a requirement for the MRAID-compliant SDK to ensure that users are always able to return to the publisher content even if an ad has an error or cannot be closed. The ad designer may provide additional design elements to close the expanded view as desired.

The location and design of the SDK-controlled close ability is left to the vendor, but is strongly recommended as a 50x50 clickable area in the top-right corner of the ad. The ad designer may optionally choose to provide the indicator for the SDK-supplied close capability, although the ad designer may not move that capability from the SDK’s specified location. If the ad designer builds the close indicator into the creative they must specify to use their custom close indicator. If the ad designer does not provide its own close graphic within the creative, the SDK will supply a close graphic of its own. This SDK-supplied clickable area will be placed at the highest z-order possible, and must always be available to the end user.

If expand was used with a URL parameter, then close must display the original content. If the SDK suspended the app when the ad changed to the expand state, then the SDK should notify the app to resume.

If the expanded or interstitial ad view was closed using the SDK-supplied close control, then the stateChange event is still fired and the app still notified to resume. Expanded ads must always listen for the stateChange event and adjust as necessary.

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: none

    events triggered: stateChange

    side effects: changes state

    level: 1

==createEvent==
{{{
	ormma.createEvent(date, title, body)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

Use this method to create a new event in the devices calendar.

    parameters:
        * date [Date - required] : the date and time of the event
        * title  [String - required] : the title of the event
        * body  [String - required] : the body of the event

    return value: none

    events triggered: none

    side effects: none

    level: 2

==expand==
{{{
	ormma.expand(url)
	mraid.expand(url)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

The expand method will cause an existing Web View (for one-part creatives) or a new Web View (for two-part creatives) to open at the highest z-order in the view hierarchy. The expanded view can either contain a new HTML document if a URL is specified, or a copy of the same document that was in the default position. While an ad is in an expanded state, the default position's HTML is suspended. Thus a complete implementation allows for ad designers to use one-part ads (where the banner and panel are part of one creative) and two-part ads (where the banner and panel are separate HTML creatives).

The expand method may change the size of the ad container, and will move state from "default" to "expanded" and fire the stateChange event. Calling expand more than once is permissible, but has no effect on state (which remains “expanded”).

An expanded view may cover all available screen area even though the ad creative may not (e.g. via a transparent overlay), or it may cover only a partial screen area. Issues of ad modality are left to the vendor. In order to avoid issues of partial screen and ad modality, use the ormma.resize method for partial screens and the ormma.expand method for full screen ads.

An expanded view must provide an end-user with the ability to close the expanded creative. These requirements are discussed further in the description of the close method.

When the ad size is greater than the screen size, the ad will be centered vertically and horizontally causing outlying areas to be cropped.

When the expand method is called without the URL parameter, the current web view will be reused, simplifying reporting and ad creation. The original creative is not reloaded and no additional impressions are recorded. Implementing this definition allows for one-part creatives.

When the expand method is called with the URL parameter, a new web view will be used. Implementing this definition allows for two-part creatives.

    parameters:
        * url [String] : The optional URL for the document to be displayed in a new overlay view. If null, the body of the current ad will be used in the current web view.

    return value: none

    events triggered: stateChange, sizeChange

    side effects: changes state

    level: 1

==getExpandProperties==
{{{
	ormma.getExpandProperties()
	mraid.getExpandProperties()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

Use this method to get the properties for expanding an ad. The properties marked with an asterisk `*` are also available in MRAID containers.

* properties object *
{{{
properties = {
 "width`*`" : "nn",
 "height`*`" : "nn", 
 "useCustomClose`*`" :  "true|false",
 "isModal`*`" : "true|false" (read-only),
 "lockOrientation" : "true|false",
 "useBackground" : "true|false (deprecated)",
 "backgroundColor" : "#rrggbb (deprecated)",
 "backgroundOpacity" : "n.n (deprecated)"
}
}}}

* "width" *
"width" is an integer that identifies the width of creative in pixels, default is full screen width

* "height" *
"height" is an integer that identifies the height of creative in pixels, default is full screen height

* "useCustomClose" *
"useCustomClose" allows the ad designer to replace the default close graphic. True, stop showing the default close graphic and rely on ad creative’s custom close indicator; false (default), container will display the default close graphic

* "isModal" *
"isModal" is a read-only property that identifies if the expanded container is modal or not. True, the SDK is providing a modal container for the expanded ad; false, the SDK is not providing a modal container for the expanded ad.

* "lockOrientation" *
The "lockOrientation" property is a boolean value (true/false) and if it is not specified in the properties object a value of false is assumed.

* "useBackground"*
"useBackground" has been deprecated. Designers should provide their own background to the HTML ad creative using CSS.

* "backgroundColor" *
"backgroundColor" has been deprecated. Designers should provide their own background to the HTML ad creative using CSS.

* "backgroundOpacity" *
"backgroundOpacity" has been deprecated. Designers should provide their own background to the HTML ad creative using CSS.

==getPlacementType==
{{{
	ormma.getPlacementType(none)
	mraid.getPlacementType(none)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.1.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

For efficiency, ad designers sometimes flight a single piece of creative in both banner and interstitial placements.  So that the creative can be aware of its placement, and therefore potentially behave differently, each ad container has a placement type determining whether the ad is being displayed inline with content (i.e. a banner) or as an interstitial overlaid content (e.g. during a content transition).  The SDK returns the value of the placement to creative so that creative can behave differently as necessary.  The SDK does not determine whether a banner is an expandable (the creative does) and thus does not return a separate type for expandable.


value 	description 
inline        	the ad placement is inline with content (i.e. a banner) in the display
interstitial   	the ad placement is over laid on top of content


    parameters:
        * none [String] : 

    return value: String - either "inline" or "interstitial"

    events triggered: none

    side effects: none

    level: 1

==getScreenSize`*`==
{{{
	ormma.getScreenSize()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

Use this method to get the current pixel width and height of the device. Although point width (pt) is preferred over pixel width (px) in the ad design because of device screens with different DPI specs, it is still essential for the designer to know how many pixels are on the screen.

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: JSON {width, height}

    events triggered: none

    related events: screenChange

    side effects: none

    level: 2

==getShakeProperties`*`==
{{{
	ormma.getShakeProperties()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

Use this method to retrieve the current shake properties.

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: JSON {interval, intensity}

    events triggered: none

    related events: shake

    side effects: none

    level: 2

==getSize==
{{{
	ormma.getSize()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

Use this method to get the current size of the ad.

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: JSON {width, height}

    events triggered: none

    related events: sizeChange

    side effects: none

    level: 1

==getState==
{{{
	ormma.getState()
	mraid.getState()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

Each ad container (or Web View) has a state that is one of the following. Note that "resized" is currently only available in ORMMA.

|| *value*  || *description*                                                                                   ||
|| loading  || the SDK is not yet ready for interactions with the Controller                                   ||
|| default  || the initial position and size of the ad container as placed by the application and SDK          ||
|| resized  || the initial position and size of the ad container has changed                                   ||
|| expanded || the ad container has expanded to cover the application content at the top of the view hierarchy ||
|| hidden   || the ad container no longer displays the ad                                                      ||

This method returns the current state of the ad container, returning whether the ad container is in its default, fixed position, a changed, resized position, or is in an expanded, larger position.

The effect on state from calling expand(), resize(), and close() are defined in this table.

|| *state* || *expand()*                  || *resize()*                 || *close()*                  ||
||loading  || no effect                   || no effect                  || no effect                  ||
||default  || state changed to “expanded” || state changed to "resized" || state changed to “hidden”  ||
||resized  || state changed to "expanded" || no effect                  || state changed to "default" ||
||expanded || no effect                   || state changed to "resized" || state changed to “default” ||
||hidden   || no effect                   || no effect                  || no effect                  ||



    parameters:
        * none

    return value: String (enumerated) - "loading", "default", "resized", "expanded", or "hidden"

    events triggered: none

    related events: stateChange

    side effects: none

    level: 1

==getTilt`*`==
{{{
	ormma.getTilt()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

This method returns the last reading of the devices 3 dimensional tilt.

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: JSON {x, y, z}

    events triggered: none

    related events: tiltChange

    side effects: none

==getVersion==
{{{
	ormma.getVersion()
	mraid.getVersion()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.1.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

This method allows the ad to confirm a basic feature set before display. The version number corresponds with the API specification version and not a vendor’s SDK version.

For example, calling mraid.getVersion() will return the MRAID version the container complies with. Calling ormma.getVersion() will return the ORMMA API version the container follows.

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: String – the API specification that this container is certified against, for example, “1.1.0”

    events triggered: none

    side effects: none

    level: 1

==hide==
{{{
	ormma.hide()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

Use this method to hide the web viewer. The method has no return value and is executed asynchronously (so always listen for a result event before taking action instead of assuming the change has occurred).

    parameters:
        * none

    return value: none

    events triggered: stateChange

    side effects: changes state

    level: 1

==isViewable==
{{{
	ormma.isViewable(none)
	mraid.isViewable(none)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.1.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

In addition to the state of the ad container, it is possible that the container is loaded off-screen as part of an application's buffer to help provide a smooth user experience. This is especially prevalent in apps that employ scrolling views.

This method returns whether the web container view showing the ad is currently on screen. 

    parameters:
        * none [String] : 

    return value: Boolean - true, container is on-screen and viewable by the user; false: container is off-screen and not viewable

    events triggered: none

    related events: viewableChange

    side effects: none

    level: 1

==makeCall==
{{{
	ormma.makeCall(phoneNumber)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0

Use this method to make a phone call on the device to the phone number provided. This is similar to a tel:// protocol, but the SDK will attempt to suspend the application.

    parameters:
        * phoneNumber [String - required] : the phone number for the device to call

    return value: none

    events triggered: none

    side effects: device may leave application to activate dialer and phone capabilites

    level: 2

==open==
{{{
	ormma.open(url)
	mraid.open(url)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

The open method will display an embedded browser window in the application that loads an external URL. On device platforms that do not allow an embedded browser, the open method invokes the native browser with the external URL.

Note: This should be used only for external web pages that are not ORMMA ads. The displayed page will not load the app’s ORMMA or MRAID files and so the close() method will not have any effect on the embedded browser. It can only be closed by the user selecting the close control for the window, which is implementation specific.

Use this method to open an HTML browser to an external web page. This may launch an external browser, depending on the SDK implementation. To place the ad over content, use the expand() method instead. 

The native browser controls – back, forward, refresh, close – will always be present. For reporting, open should always be used for click through actions.



    parameters:
        * url [String - required] : the URL of the web page to open

    return value: none

    events triggered: none

    side effects: application may be unavailable while user explores URL

    level: 1

==openMap`*`==
{{{
	ormma.openMap(POI, fullscreen)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.1

Use this method to open a native map with the Point of Interest (POI) parameter formatted according to the Google Maps standard (see http://mapki.com/wiki/Google_Map_Parameters)

    parameters:
        * POI [String - required] : Google Maps-formatted argument. The parameter must describe a point on a map, not, for example, driving directions
        * fullscreen [Boolean, default value = true] : true - map displays within the current View, false - within a new View that takes up the whole screen

    return value: none

    events triggered: none

    side effects: device may require user permission for geolocation data

    level: 2

==playAudio==
{{{
	ormma.playAudio(url, properties)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.0.1

Use this method to play audio on the device. This may launch an external player, depending on the SDK implementation. To place the audio with the content, set the position property. For the most part, properties follow the HTML5 audio tag conventions.

Controls:
|| *property* || *values*          || *description*                                                                                                                               ||

==useCustomClose==
{{{
	ormma.useCustomClose(flag)
	mraid.useCustomClose(flag)
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.1.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

Although it is required that all implementing SDKs provide a clickable area with a default “close” graphic, it is possible for ad creators to use their own designs.

This method serves as a convenience method to the expand property of the same name. Setting the property or calling this method both have the same effect and can be used interchangeably. They signal to stop using the default close indicator.

For expanded ads, the designer does not need to call this method and would normally set the useCustomClose property in setExpandProperties().

For a stand-alone interstitial where there is no call to expand(), but there is still a close() requirement, the ad designer should call this method as early as possible.

Ad designers should be clear that a default close indicator will always show until the useCustomClose method is called and/or the property is set.

    parameters:
        * flag [Boolean - required] : true – ad creative supplies its own designs for the close area; false – default image will be displayed for the close area

    return value: none

    events triggered: none

==ready==
{{{
	"ready" -> function()
}}}
API version history
* Introduced in ORMMA version: 1.1.0
* Included in MRAID version: 1

The ready event triggers when the SDK is fully loaded, initialized, and ready for any calls from the ad creative.

It is the responsibility of the container to prepare the API methods before the ad creative is loaded. This prevents a condition where the ad cannot register to listen for the ready event because the API methods are unavailable. However, the container may still need more time to initialize settings or prepare additional features.

The ad should always attempt to wait for the ready event before executing any rich media operations. Because of timing issues, such as the ready event firing before the ad has registered to listen, ad designers should use the ready event in conjunction with the getState() method.

{{{
 function showMyAd() { ...
}
if (mraid.getState() === 'loading') { mraid.addEventListener('ready', showMyAd);
} else {
}
showMyAd();
}}}
