=Certifying SDKs for ORMMA Compliance=
All compliant SDKs are announced on the ORMMA Blog. http://blog.ormma.org/. The blog is the only official notification for ORMMA compliance.


==Test Ads==
The test ads in the source code should be loaded into an application with your SDK. The test ads can be loaded into an Ad Server as third-party HTML ads and then added to your application, or they can be referenced directly.

Each test ad has a written description of the expected behavior. The ORMMA code group is continuing to refine these test ads to make them easier to understand and faster to test.

Once your application displays the ad according to the test description, you should submit it to the ORMMA code group. You must submit an application for each platform.


==Support==
If you need support at any time, please email the ORMMA the discussion group. http://groups.google.com/group/ormma-discussion


==ORMMA Certification==
The ORMMA code group will review the ad behavior in your application and contact you directly with any questions or comments. It is the intent of the code group to certify your SDK quickly -- yesterday if possible -- but probably in a couple of days.


==Blog Entry==
The ORMMA outreach group will work with you to craft the blog post. It is recommended that you link to the blog post in your own marketing materials.
