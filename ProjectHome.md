# Open Rich Media Mobile Advertising #
ORMMA is an industry wide initiative for advertisers to have one common set of rules for displaying rich media ads across platforms. Ad designers that have one API to use when creating ads know that their ad will display on all ORMMA-compliant apps and sites.

## The API for Ad Creators ##
The ORMMA standard is split into three levels to simplify understanding and adoption.
  * [Level 1](http://code.google.com/p/ormma/wiki/Level1_Requirements) - expand and collapse
  * [Level 2](http://code.google.com/p/ormma/wiki/Level2_Requirements) - access native features
  * [Level 3](http://code.google.com/p/ormma/wiki/Level3_Requirements) - cache content

## Reference Code for SDK Builders ##
[ORMMA is not an SDK](http://blog.ormma.org/2010/12/yet-another-sdk-no.html). However, the code group developed a reference implementation to better understand, test, and prove the concepts of the ORMMA API in the field. This code is open-source under BSD license and available to use in your applications -- or simply as a sample code for implementing your own ORMMA-compliant SDK.
