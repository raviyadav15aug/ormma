# Joining ORMMA #
There are multiple ways to join ORMMA. As an industry-wide initiative, help is encouraged and welcomed from all sides.


## Observers ##
You do _not_ need to join ORMMA to take part in the benefits. You can use the ORMMA API and even the reference code at any time without joining any group.

The ORMMA API is published under Creative Commons and the reference implementation is open source with the BSD license to allow anyone to use it for commercial purposes.



## Change or Update Specifications ##
To make comments about the API specifications, or send in new ideas, please use the discussion group:
http://groups.google.com/group/ormma-discussion

Everyone can become a member of the discussion group. Invitations to training webinars are also sent to all members of the discussion group.


## Get Support ##
If you found a bug in the reference code, or found an error in the API specification, please let us know. All issues are logged at: http://code.google.com/p/ormma/issues/list


## Be a Code Contributor ##
If you are a developer and want to contribute to the reference code, sample ads, help files, or be part of the compliance team, please consider joining the ORMMA code group. You can submit your request to http://groups.google.com/group/ormma-code/

Rules for code contribution are under review and should be approved by the ORMMA code group soon.

The code group has a standing call every Friday at 1:00PM Eastern time.
